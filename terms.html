      <h3>What information we collect about you</h3>
      <div class="height-box"></div>
      <p>

      information you provide to us to book and manage travel, accommodation,
      car rental, group events such as conferences and meetings, and other
      related products and services on your behalf and as your agent. We use
      your personal preferences and requirements when coordinating timetables
      and availability, and your financial and contact details to purchase,
      deliver and provide notifications of reservations and other communications
      related to these services. We may collect personal information about you

      into our billing processes. Where you have booked through a business we
      may provide your journey data and other associated reporting to the
      assigned business contact for management information. For business or
      corporate customers, your access to the Services is provided via a

      <h3>How we use information we collect from you</h3>
      <div class="height-box"></div>
      <p>
        How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services
        you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to
        us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we
        collect about you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <b>To provide the Services and personalise your experience:</b>
      <br />
      <br />We use information about you to provide the Services to you, such as
      booking and managing travel and accommodation, renting vehicles, providing
      peripheral services such as visa assistance and travel insurance,
      arranging and managing events and tours, and providing travel technology
      solutions, among others. <br />We use the information about you to process
      transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer
      support, and operate and maintain the Services. <br />Our Services also
      include tailored features that personalise your experience by
      automatically analysing your activities to provide search results,
      notifications, and recommendations that are most relevant for you. Where
      you use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your
      activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to
      find information from one Service while searching from another or to
      present relevant product information. <br /><br /><b
        >To communicate with you about the Services:</b
      >
      <br /><br />
      We use your contact information to send transactional communications via
      email and within the Services, including confirming your bookings,
      providing itineraries, providing customer support, and sending you
      technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.
      These communications are part of the Services, and in most cases, you are
      unable to opt out of them. If an opt out option is available, you will
      find that option within the communication itself or in your account
      settings.
      <br /><br />
      <b>To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services:</b>
      <br /><br />
      We use your contact information and information about how you use the
      Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific
      interest to you, including by email. These communications are aimed at
      driving engagement and maximising what you get out of the Services,
      including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters,
      and events we think may be of interest to you. We also communicate with
      you about new product offers, promotions and contests. You can control
      whether you receive these communications as described below under “Opt-out
      of communications”.
